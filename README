This is the 850 micron source catalogues for the 46 candidate protoclusters selected in M17 and the discussions in this section. Each .cat file corresponds to a single candidate protocluster, with filename as [protocluster name].cat. The descriptions of each column:

ID: source ID in each candidate protocluster
RA, Dec: positions of the peak flux density of the source, in degree.
SNR: signal-to-noise ratio
flux_density_mJy: Peak, deboosted flux density of the source, in mJy.
flux_density_err_mJy: Deboosted flux density error, in mJy. A 5% calibration error is also included.
